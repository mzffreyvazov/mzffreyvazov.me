I am a Computer Science student with strong skills in backend and full-stack development. My expertise includes Java, Spring Boot, Python, RESTful APIs, and relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL). I also have experience with cloud platforms (OCI, Google Cloud, AWS), AI/ML tools, and modern frontend frameworks like React and Vaadin.

I enjoy building robust & valuable web applications and tools, and have developed several personal projects involving AI, automation, and productivity. I am passionate about learning new technologies and solving challenging problems.
