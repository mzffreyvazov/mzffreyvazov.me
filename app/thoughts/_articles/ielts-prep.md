Hello everyone,

I finally took the IELTS exam (computer-based), and I’m very satisfied with the results. I took **Speaking** on October 21 (video call at the test centre) and **Listening, Reading, and Writing** on October 22. The results came out just one day later.

I prepared entirely on my own for about **two months**. I booked my test through the **British Council**, which gave me free access to the *IELTS Ready Premium* package. It offered some extra practice tests, but I didn’t find them very effective for Listening and Reading. The interface felt uncomfortable, I couldn’t highlight text easily, and when I switched between questions, my highlights disappeared.

## Background

I’m not a native speaker, and I’ve never been to an English-speaking country. I started learning English about **6–7 years ago** for my university entrance exam, and since then, I’ve been exposed to the language every day. Most of the videos I watch on YouTube and most of the books I read are in English, for instance.

However, I haven’t had many chances to practice **speaking** with native speakers (mostly just talking to myself), and I also didn’t do much **writing** before my IELTS preparation period.

## Reading

**General:** I used only the **Cambridge IELTS** books (20 - 17) and did all tests on **engnovate.com**. If you’re taking the computer-based test, I highly recommend it; the interface is very close to the real exam. I completed **13 full practice tests**. I took notes in **Obsidian**, reviewed every mistake, and wrote short tips for the next attempt. When I noticed patterns (e.g., **True/False/Not Given**), I generated targeted mini-lessons with AI based on the questions I got wrong.

**My strategy:** I would first read the questions and try to understand what each one was asking for. I also tried to identify the differences between each option. Then I highlighted the important details in the question (but not in the options, since that would take too much time). After that, I skimmed the passage and highlighted key details such as names, dates, places, or any other information I thought might be important. Once I found the relevant part of the text for a question, I read that section carefully and wrote my answer. I didn’t rush to answer as soon as I located the section; instead, I made sure I fully understood what was being said and what exactly the question was asking. I applied the same approach for the remaining two passages.

## Listening

**General:** Again, I used only the **Cambridge IELTS books** and practised all tests on **engnovate.com**. After each test, I carefully reviewed and understood all my mistakes. My main struggle was **focus**: sometimes I would overthink one answer, and as a result, I’d miss or answer the next one incorrectly.

**My strategy:** I started reading the questions as soon as the listening began. For **Part 1**, it’s quite easy to read all the questions and understand the context in the given time. I highlighted **2–3 words before each blank**. I tried to predict the type of answer expected, given the context and the sentence. For me, **Parts 2 and 3** were the most challenging, especially when there were multiple-choice questions (on test day, I got six MCQs in both Part 2 and Part 3 lol). So, I would move to **Part 2 immediately after finishing Part 1** and read the questions as quickly as possible. I highlighted the key words in the options, usually 2–3 words that captured the main meaning of each option. Once I made sure I had covered all the questions (for example, 11–16), I went back to the start and focused on them as the listening began. While listening, if I realized that one option was definitely not correct, I removed its highlight; this helped me stay focused only on the remaining options. **Highlighting** and **removing the highlight as** you listen and eliminating options was especially important for **matching-type questions**.

## Writing

**General:** I honestly didn’t practice writing as much as I wanted to (I procrastinated a lot, lol). I did some practice tasks for diagrams I found online or from the Cambridge IELTS books, but not in a disciplined way or under exam conditions. I only managed to do one **full-time mock test** the day before the exam. As you can guess, my writing experience on the actual test day wasn’t great. I finished **Task 2** with only about **20 seconds left**, and **Task 1** took too long (around 25–30 minutes) because I started off wrong and misunderstood the bar charts. Naturally, I didn’t have time to check for spelling or grammar errors.

Still, I think the formula for achieving a **Band 7–7.5** in writing is quite straightforward, and it’s probably the reason I got a 7. Just before the exam, I focused on the fundamentals: common vocabulary for different types of Task 1 essays, reviewing **Task 2 essay structures**, and reading sample essays. For **Task 1**, the vocabulary and language are quite limited, so consistent practice helps a lot. For **Task 2**, the structures are already there. You just need to learn them and apply them using simple, precise language, and you can easily reach Band 7.

I used **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (on [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)) extensively, especially at the beginning of my preparation. I mainly evaluated my essays using **checklist questions** for each assessment criterion (TA, CC, LR, GRA). This approach helped me analyze exactly what to improve, whether it was idea development, coherence, vocabulary use, or grammar accuracy. I created **4–6 questions per criterion**, along with a **reusable evaluation prompt**, which I’ve included in the Drive folder. There is also a guide on how to use them (look at the README file).

During the final few days before the exam, I switched to **ChatGPT Plus** for quick one-time evaluations. I would paste the **official band descriptors (from Band 4 to 9)**, along with the question and/or diagram, and ask it to assess my essay based on those criteria. The most valuable part of this process wasn’t the band score itself, but the **evaluation and feedback**, especially identifying grammar mistakes, unnatural word choices, and stylistic issues, and learning how to fix them.

**My strategy:** For **Task 1**, I found the videos from **BestMyTest** on YouTube very useful. For **Task 2**, I used the essay structures from IELTS Advantage; I compiled all of them into one file (available in the Drive).

For **Task 1**, planning is really important. Group the given information and note the main changes and relevant comparisons for each group. Identify the overall trend, then write your full answer based on those notes.

For **Task 2**, take brief notes about what you’ll write: your arguments, opinions, and examples. Then, using the correct structure for that essay type, build your response around those ideas. Read as many sample essays as you can: the more familiar you become with the style, the easier writing will get. You can check out IELTS Advantage’s 100 sample essays for Task 2, or even generate examples with AI based on the structure (also available in the Drive).

## Speaking

**General:** My speaking was already fairly good before I started preparing. I began practising **Part 2** about **3–4 days before the exam** using the *IELTS Speaking 2025* app. I recorded my voice and, at the same time, used **ChatGPT’s voice-to-text** feature to transcribe my speech. I then used that transcription for evaluation: I would paste the **official marking criteria for Speaking**, along with the **cue card**, my **prepared bullet points**, and finally the **transcribed speech**. It worked really well; I was consistently getting **Band 7–7.5**, and I actually got **7.5** on the real test.

I also found the **GEL IELTS** Speaking classes (included in the British Council preparation package) very useful. Those videos are in the Drive folder as well. Another technique that helped me improve fluency was watching videos in English and **pausing frequently** to repeat what was said, while adding extra context or commentary in my own words. It’s a great exercise to build both fluency and spontaneous thinking. A few days before the exam, I tried to **speak out loud as much as possible**, think in English, and basically keep my mind operating in English all day. It really helped me switch my brain into “English mode.” My general advice is: just talk as much as you can.

**My strategy:** I think there isn’t much of a fixed “strategy” for Speaking, especially for **Part 1** and **Part 3**: just be natural and give honest answers and PRACTICE A LOT. For **Part 2**, I created **3–4 short bullet points** for each bullet point in the cue card and spoke freely around those ideas. I didn’t overthink what to talk about; I simply expanded on whatever came to mind. This helped me structure my answers naturally and keep my flow going.

I treated the speaking test as a **casual conversation with a stranger**, which really helped me relax on test day. The examiner seemed genuinely engaged and asked follow-up questions based on my previous answers; that interaction made the whole experience feel much smoother and more comfortable for me.

There’s also an Instagram page that I highly recommend: @**progress.playground** (on both Instagram and TikTok). His videos are excellent, especially for developing fluency and natural flow. One strategy I learned from him, and found really useful, is to **use the last idea or word in your sentence to build the next one**, so your speech keeps moving forward smoothly. I couldn’t find the original video right now, but I’ll link it once I do.

For example:

>“I love reading self-improvement books because they help me understand myself better. *Understanding myself better* also makes it easier to deal with stress. *Stress* is something everyone faces, especially students, so learning to manage it effectively is really important.”

This technique helps you stay fluent, avoid pauses, and naturally extend your answers.

One more thing that really helped me was **removing negative self-talk**. I stopped telling myself things like “I’ll mess this up” or “I don’t sound fluent enough.” Instead, I kept a **positive, confident mindset**, reminding myself that it’s just a speaking test, nothing more. I told myself to relax and that everything would be fine. It’s just a conversation.

Try to think of the examiner as someone who’s **genuinely curious about your answers** and **wants to get to know you**. Be curious about *your own* responses too, and enjoy explaining and expanding your thoughts. That mindset shift alone makes you sound more confident and authentic.

Don’t try to show off by using unnecessarily fancy words or memorised phrases. Keep it **honest, natural, and clear**. The goal isn’t to impress or give the most correct answers; it’s to **communicate YOUR ideas effectively and comfortably**.

## Focus and Concentration Techniques

During my preparation, I realized that mental focus can be trained just like any other skill. I experimented with small techniques that helped me stay fully present during practice tests, and they worked surprisingly well on the real exam day too.

When I was practicing Listening, I deliberately tried to minimize blinking (you can watch [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAwBdRR4wQk&t=1171s) from huberman lab or read [the summary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nRGzrWTiGXR6M0h6CZYT3pGJWP5FJD3w/view?usp=drive_link)) and reduce unnecessary body movements. It might sound odd, but it helped me stay fully locked onto the audio. I imagined there was a narrow tunnel between me and the computer screen, and everything else outside that tunnel faded away. This visualization helped me maintain attention and prevented my mind from wandering.

The same technique worked for Reading as well. By keeping my body still and eyes focused within that imaginary tunnel, I could process information faster and avoid distractions. Even though I didn’t consciously plan to apply this method on the test day, my body naturally did it due to the stress and focus of the moment.

## Overall

* Do **a lot of practice** for **all sections**.
* Make sure you get enough sleep on your test day. Staying up all night and trying to cram vocab, etc, is the worst thing you can do.
* Drink water!!!
* Drinking coffee 30-60 minutes before the exam can increase your alertness and focus.
* Make sure you go to the WC and you are comfortable before the exam starts.
* Don't do any practice test for LRW on the test day. Keep your energy for the actual test.
* **Analyze** your mistakes. Understand why you made each mistake and how you can improve it.
* **Time management** is key, especially in **Listening** and **Writing**. Practice regularly so you know what to expect and how to manage your time effectively during the test.
* For **Writing**, read plenty of sample essays. Familiarize yourself with the style, pick one structure, and stick with it. Don’t overthink your ideas — **simple is best**.
* For **Speaking**, talk out loud as much as possible. Try to be articulate. Read books, summarize them, and discuss your thoughts — anything that helps you express ideas clearly.
