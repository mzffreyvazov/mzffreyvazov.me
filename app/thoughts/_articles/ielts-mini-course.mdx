			![[Pasted image 20250221003842.png]]
		- paraphrasing:
			- common errors are: changing every singe word, 
			- how to paraphrase: synonyms and changing the stucture 
			- paraphrasing checklist: 
				- does the sentence mean the same as the question?
				- any vocabulary & semantic errors?
				- is the sentece grammatically correct?
			- paraphrased sentence doesn't need to be fancy, it just needs to be effective
			- A well-structured, coherent argument with relevant examples and varied but natural language will always score higher than an essay stuffed with complex words used incorrectly or awkwardly. Examiners look for natural fluency, logical progression, and accurate language use, not just impressive vocabulary or intricate sentence structures.  In short: **Effectiveness > Complexity**.
		- your introduction should match up with the main body. if you write about two ideas in your introduction, then you should include all those ideas in your main bodies.
		- outline checklist (intro = paraphrased statement + outline):
			- did you clearly answer both questions?
			- are your ideas relevant and specific
			- are there any linguistic errors
		- main problems in outline and introduction:

		- you should develop your ideas **fully**
		- three elements to a main body paragraph:
			- topic sentence:
				- tells the reader what the paragraph is about
				- essential for [[IELTS exam structure#Writing|task response and also for coherence and cohesion]] 
				- it should be short and simple, it doesn't need to be a complex sentence
				- you lose marks for repeating words/phrases, not ideas.
				- deploy paraphrasing again. 
			- explanation:
				- do not assume that the reader knows what your topic sentence means or how to answer the question
				- the reader can't ask you follow up questions, so explain everything
				- pretend you are explaining it to someone who knows nothing about the topic  
				![[Pasted image 20250221154834.png]]
			- examples:
				- the examiner want to know that you know how to use examples
				- the examples should be directly linked to your main point and support it
				- they do not need to be true, but make sense
				- example on how to write one:
					- Recent research concluded that...... + what you are trying to prove. 
					- A recent study found that...... + what you are trying to prove.
				- you can use newspaper/magazine stories, youtube videos
				- personal examples are okay but be very careful
				- examples:

		- supporting paragraph 2
		- conclusion
	- idea generation:
		- decide an opinion: you agree or disagree?
		- choose the one that you feel you have more ideas for

			- not giving your opinion
			- not supporting your opinion with main ideas
			- using an informal style
			- good and bad examples:
				- GOOD: Rising global temperatures and human health and fitness issues are often viewed as being caused by the expanding use of automobiles. This essay agrees that the increasing use of motor vehicles contributes to rising global temperatures because of the production of greenhouse gases by vehicles and certain health issues are caused by the release of toxic chemicals by internal combustion engines.
				- BAD: Nowadays, cars are a very popular way of getting around. Day by day many more people drive cars around but others feel that they cause global warming. Global warming is one of the most serious issues in modern life. They also affect people’s health and well-being which is also a serious issue.

			- [[How to Paraphrase in the IELTS Test|paraphrase]] question
			- give opinion
			- support opinion with 2 ideas
		- three elements for introduction (**opinion essay**):
			- paraphrase question
				- we restate it with a different meaning using synonyms. I will also reorder the question.
				- question: In some countries, an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems due to eating too much fast food. It is, therefore, necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food.
				- paraphrased: It is argued that governments should levy a tariff on junk food because the health risks associated with consuming this kind of food are rising. 
			- thesis statement
				- this is your opinion in one sentence
				- example: This essay agrees that a higher rate of tax should be paid by fast-food companies.
			- outline sentence
				- this sentence outlines what you will write about in the main body paragpraphs
				- example: Firstly, alcohol and tobacco companies already pay higher taxes; secondly, higher taxes could raise prices and lower consumption.
		- main checklist: **paraphrase question + thesis statement + outline sentence**
		- example introduction (**opinion essay**):
			- checklist reviewed: **paraphrased question + thesis statement + outline sentence**
			- Full introduction: It is argued that governments should levy a tariff on junk food  because the number of health risks associated with consuming this kind of food is on the rise. This essay agrees that a higher rate of tax should be paid by fast-food companies. Firstly, alcohol and tobacco companies already pay higher taxes; secondly, higher taxes could raise prices and lower consumption.
	- supporting paragraph 1:
		- three elements for supporting paragraph 1:
			- topic sentence
				- tells the reader what the paragraph is about. it is a **summary** of your **first idea**. 
				- keep it short and simple. 
				- use paraphrasing again
				- **example**: Higher excise on liqueur and cigarettes has proven to curb the harm caused by these substances.
			- explanation:
				- a great tip: assume that the examiner knows nothing about the topic
				- you must explain **clearly** what you mean
				- **example**: This revenue has been used to treat health problems associated with these products and has proven useful in advertising campaigns warning people about the dangers of alcohol and tobacco abuse. Tax from fast food could be used in the same way.
			- examples:
				- the example you give should support your point
				- Think about any recent news stories, studies or adverts. If you can’t think of one, make one up. The examiner won’t check if it is real or not.
				- **example**: The United Kingdom is a prime example, where money from smokers is used to treat lung cancer and heart disease while at the same time, pumped into health campaigns in schools to warn children about the dangers of smoking.
		- example supporting paragraph 1:
			- total 4 sentence
			- outline checklist: **topic sentence** + **explanation** + **examples**
			- paragraph: Higher excise on liqueur and cigarettes has proven to curb the harm caused by these substances. This revenue has been used to treat health problems associated with these products and has proven useful in advertising campaigns warning people about the dangers of alcohol and tobacco abuse. Tax from fast food could be used in the same way. The United Kingdom is a prime example, where money from smokers is used to treat lung cancer and heart disease
	- supporting paragraph 2: 
		- it is the same formula as the first one
		- example supporting paragraph 2:
			- total 4 sentence
			- outline checklist: **topic sentence** + **explanation** + **examples**
			- paragraph: Increasing taxes would raise prices and lower consumption. Fast food companies would pass on these taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, leading to people not being able to afford junk food because it is too expensive. Junk food would soon become a luxury item, and it would only be consumed occasionally, which would be less harmful to the general public’s health. For instance, the cost of organic food has proven prohibitively expensive for most people, and that is why only a small percentage of the population buys it regularly.  
	- conclusion:
		- two elements for conclusion:
			- summary of your main points
			- you opinion
		- remeber:
			- do not write new ideas in this paragraph
			- A good conclusion should restate your thesis statement and your main supporting points.
			- paraphrasing again
		- outline checklist: **start with cohesive device** + **summarise your main points + your opinion
		- example: In conclusion, junk food should be taxed at a higher rate because of the good precedent set by alcohol and tobacco and the fact that the increased cost should reduce the number of fast-food people buy.
	- complete essay example:
		- question: In some countries, many people suffer from health problems due to eating too much fast food. It is, therefore, necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. Do you agree or disagree?
		- answer:
			It is argued that governments should **levy a tariff** on junk food because the number of health risks associated with consuming this kind of food is on the rise. This essay agrees that a higher rate of tax should be paid by fast-food companies. Firstly, alcohol and tobacco companies already pay higher taxes; secondly, higher taxes could raise prices and lower consumption.

			Higher **excise on** liqueur and cigarettes has proven to curb the harm caused by these substances. This revenue has been used to treat health problems associated with these products and has proven useful in advertising campaigns warning people about the dangers of alcohol and tobacco abuse. Tax from fast food could be used in the same way. The United Kingdom is a prime example, where money from smokers is used to treat lung cancer and heart disease.

			Increasing taxes would raise prices and lower consumption. Fast food companies would pass on these taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, leading to people not being able to afford junk food because it is too expensive. Junk food would soon become a luxury item, and it would only be consumed occasionally, which would be less harmful to the general public’s health. For instance, the cost of organic food has proven prohibitively expensive for most people, and that is why only a small percentage of the population buys it regularly.
			
			In conclusion, junk food should be taxed at a higher rate because of the good precedent set by alcohol and tobacco and the fact that the increased cost should reduce the amount of fast-food people buy. 
#### Discussion essays
	- Structure of your essay
		- introduction
		- main body 1: discuss the first view
		- main body 2: discuss the second view
		- conclusion
	- idea generation.
		- for discussion essays, you must brainstorm ideas for **both** sides of the argument.
		- you do not have to give equal attention to both sides, but you must discuss them both before giving your own opinion.
		- decide which side you agree with more. this will be your final opinion.
		- keep it simple. you only need one main idea for each viewpoint to develop in your main body paragraphs. The first ideas are often the easiest to explain.
	- introduction:
		- the introduction for a discussion essay sets the stage by presenting both sides of the argument and clearly stating your own position.
		- common problems in discussion essay introductions:
			- only mentioning one side of the argument.
			- not giving a clear opinion (thesis statement).
			- not paraphrasing the question properly.
		- four elements to a discussion essay introduction:
			- paraphrase question
				- re-state the question in your own words using synonyms and changing the sentence structure.
			- state both points of view
				- you must acknowledge both sides of the argument presented in the question.
				- you can use phrases like "Some people believe that..., while others argue that..."
			- thesis statement
				- this is your opinion. you clearly state which side of the argument you agree with.
			- outline sentence
				- briefly mention what the essay will cover. (Note: sometimes the thesis and outline can be combined into one clear sentence).
		- main checklist: **paraphrase question + state both views + thesis statement**
		- example introduction:
			- question: Computers are being used more and more in education. Some people say this is a positive trend, while others argue that it leads to negative consequences. Discuss both sides of this argument and then give your own opinion.
			- **Full Introduction**: There is an ever-increasing use of technology, such as tablets and laptops, in the classroom. **(Paraphrase)** It is often argued that this is a positive development, whilst others disagree and think it will lead to adverse ramifications. **(State both views)** This essay agrees that an increase in technology is beneficial to students and teachers. **(Thesis Statement)**
	- main body paragraph 1: discuss the first view
		- this paragraph will explore the **first** side of the argument.
		- three elements for main body paragraph 1:
			- topic sentence:
				- state the first viewpoint clearly. This tells the reader what the paragraph is about.
				- **example**: The internet has provided students with access to more information than ever before.
			- explanation:
				- explain this viewpoint in more detail. Why do people hold this view?
				- remember to pretend you are explaining it to someone who knows nothing about the topic.
				- **example**: Moreover, learners can research and learn about any subject at the touch of a button. It is therefore agreed that technology is a very worthwhile tool for education.
			- examples:
				- provide a specific example to support the point. It does not need to be real, but it must be relevant and make sense.
				- **example**: Wikipedia is a prime example, where students can type in any keyword and gain access to in-depth knowledge quickly and easily.
	- main body paragraph 2: discuss the second view
		- this paragraph follows the same structure but explores the **second** side of the argument.
		- three elements for main body paragraph 2:
			- topic sentence:
				- state the second viewpoint clearly. Use a linking word like 'However,' or 'On the other hand,'.
				- **example**: However, many disagree and feel that technology deprives people of real human interaction.
			- explanation:
				- explain this second viewpoint. What are the reasons behind this argument?
				- **example**: Human interaction teaches people valuable skills such as discourse, debate and empathy. Despite this, human interaction is still possible through the internet, and this essay disagrees that technology should be dismissed for this reason.
			- examples:
				- provide a relevant example that supports this second point.
				- **example**: For instance, Skype and Facebook allow people to interact in ways that were never before possible.
	- conclusion:
		- your conclusion should summarise both viewpoints and clearly state your own opinion one last time.
		- two main elements for the conclusion:
			- summary of main points
				- briefly summarise the two opposing views you have discussed in your main body paragraphs.
			- reiterate your opinion
				- state which view you think is better or more important. This should be consistent with the thesis statement in your introduction.
		- outline checklist: **start with cohesive device** + **summarise both views** + **re-state your final opinion**
		- remember: **no new ideas** in the conclusion.
		- example conclusion:
			- In conclusion, while the benefits of technology, particularly the internet, allow students to tap into limitless sources of information, some still feel that people should be wary of this new phenomenon and not allow it to curb face-to-face interaction. However, as long as we carefully consider the importance of human interaction in education, the educational benefits are clearly positive.
#### Advantages and Disadvantages essays
	- **Two Types of Advantages & Disadvantages Essays**
		- It is crucial to identify which type of question you are being asked, as they require different answers.
		- **Type 1: Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.**
			- Question example: *...Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.*
			- This type requires a balanced discussion. You present the advantages in one paragraph and the disadvantages in another. You **do not** give your opinion.
		- **Type 2: Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?**
			- Question example: *Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?*
			- This type asks for your opinion. You must decide which side is stronger and state this clearly in your introduction and conclusion. Your essay structure will be based on arguing for your chosen position.
			- For example, there might be many advantages to a private jet, but the single huge disadvantage (the cost) outweighs them for most people. The number of points doesn't matter; their "weight" or importance does.
	- **Type 1: Discuss the Advantages and Disadvantages**
		- **Structure of your essay:**
			- introduction
			- main body 1: advantages
			- main body 2: disadvantages
			- conclusion
		- **Introduction:**
			- For this type, the introduction simply introduces the topic and states that you will discuss both sides.
			- two elements for the introduction:
				- paraphrase question
					- re-state the topic in your own words.
				- outline sentence
					- state that the essay will discuss the pros and cons of the topic.
					- **example**: This essay will suggest that experience gained and money saved are the biggest advantages of this, but delaying careers and reducing motivation to study are the primary disadvantages.
		- **Main Body Paragraph 1 (Advantages):**
			- This paragraph is dedicated only to the advantages.
			- three elements for this paragraph:
				- topic sentence
					- state the main advantages you will discuss.
					- **example**: The main advantages of a gap year are learning more about the world and earning money.
				- explanation
					- explain each advantage in more detail.
					- **example**: For students who have just finished secondary school, working or travelling for a year will allow them to learn what life is like outside of the education system. Also, third-level education is very expensive, and many students decide to work for 12 months and save money before they begin their studies.
				- example
					- provide a specific example to support one of your points.
					- **example**: The average student at a UK university requires over £10,000 per annum to survive, and many drop out because they cannot afford to stay.
		- **Main Body Paragraph 2 (Disadvantages):**
			- This paragraph follows the same structure but focuses on the disadvantages.
			- outline checklist: **topic sentence** + **explanation** + **example**
			- **example paragraph**: Despite these advantages, students lose a year that could have been used to advance their future careers, and they often get used to working or travelling and don’t want to return to a life of study. As job markets are very competitive, an extra year of experience can make a massive difference when applying for jobs, and those who took a gap year are at a disadvantage. Moreover, some decide to bypass university altogether and go straight into a job that is beneath their capabilities or may not offer the same prospects their future career might have. For instance, jobs in the service industry are easy to get without a third-level education, and many gap students fill these roles only to be stuck in them for the rest of their lives.
		- **Conclusion:**
			- The conclusion provides a simple summary of the points you have made.
			- remember: **Do not give your opinion** for this essay type.
			- **example**: In conclusion, taking a break from studies can be advantageous if it allows people to accumulate savings or learn more about the world. However, they should also be careful that it does not delay the start of their careers and lead to disillusionment with education.
	- **Type 2: Do the Advantages Outweigh the Disadvantages?**
		- **Structure of your essay:**
			- introduction (with your opinion)
			- main body 1: discuss the stronger side
			- main body 2: discuss the weaker side (and why it's weaker)
			- conclusion (re-stating your opinion)
		- **Idea Generation:**
			- Before you write, you must decide which side is stronger: the advantages or the disadvantages.
			- Your entire essay will be built around proving why your chosen side "outweighs" the other.
		- **Introduction:**
			- This introduction must clearly state your position.
			- three elements for the introduction:
				- paraphrase question
				- thesis statement
					- this is your opinion. Clearly state whether the advantages or the disadvantages outweigh the other.
					- **example**: This essay will argue that the advantages of this outweigh the drawbacks.
				- outline sentence
					- briefly outline the points you will use to support your position.
					- **example**: The essay will first demonstrate that the earlier someone learns an additional language, the more likely they are to master it and that it brings added cognitive benefits, followed by an analysis of how the primary disadvantage, namely confusion with their native tongue, is not valid.
		- **Main Body Paragraph 1 (The Stronger Side):**
			- This paragraph discusses the side you believe is stronger (e.g., the advantages).
			- You should fully develop your points here to show why they are so significant.
			- outline checklist: **topic sentence** + **explanation** + **example**
			- **example paragraph**: The main reason to start kids off with foreign languages early is that this increases the likelihood they will achieve fluency in adulthood. That is to say that they will have far more years to perfect their skills, and speaking bilingually will seem perfectly normal. For example, in countries such as Holland and Norway, where English is taught from a very young age, most adults speak it at an advanced level. Learning a second language also helps to improve overall cognitive abilities. In other words, it benefits the overall development of a child’s brain. It is well known that bi-lingual children are significantly more likely to score higher in Mathematics and Science.
		- **Main Body Paragraph 2 (The Weaker Side):**
			- This paragraph discusses the opposing view (e.g., the disadvantages), but your goal is to show why it is less important or "weaker".
			- You can introduce the point and then explain why it is not a significant issue.
			- **example paragraph**: Those opposed to this say that it causes the child to become confused between their mother tongue and the other language. However, there is actually no evidence to support this view and children from bilingual families do just as well in both languages. My son was brought up speaking both Vietnamese and English and outperforms most of his classmates in both.
		- **Conclusion:**
			- Your conclusion summarizes the essay and confidently re-states your position from the introduction.
			- two elements for the conclusion:
				- summary of the main points from both sides.
				- final restatement of your opinion (which side outweighs the other).
			- **example**: On balance, the fact that early foreign language learning leads to higher fluency and improved brain function clearly outweighs the flawed argument that it impairs the uptake of native languages.

	- Structure of your essay
		- introduction
		- main body 1: Causes
		- main body 2: Effects
		- conclusion
	- idea generation.
		- first, read the question and identify the core problem or situation.
		- brainstorm a list of possible causes (reasons why the situation exists).
		- brainstorm a list of possible effects (results or consequences of the situation).
		- from your lists, choose the **two strongest and easiest-to-explain causes** and the **two strongest and easiest-to-explain effects**. You only need to develop a few points well.
	- introduction:
		- your introduction should be short and direct, telling the reader exactly what to expect.
		- two elements for a cause and effect introduction:
			- paraphrase the question
				- restate the problem or situation from the question in your own words.
				- **original statement**: "Health problems including heart disease, obesity, and diabetes are becoming more widespread in developed countries."
			- outline sentence
				- state that the essay will examine the causes and effects of this issue.
				- **example**: This essay will discuss the primary causes of this trend, such as lifestyle choices, and explore its significant long-term effects.
		- example introduction:
			- **paraphrased question + outline sentence**
			- Full Introduction: Health problems including heart disease, obesity, and diabetes are becoming more widespread in developed countries. There are several reasons contributing to this problem, as well as potentially drastic long-term effects.
	- main body paragraph 1 (Causes):
		- this paragraph must focus **only on the causes**.
		- four elements for the causes paragraph:
			- topic sentence:
				- state that the paragraph will discuss the main causes of the issue.
				- **example**: Lifestyle choices are important and major causes of poor health in developed countries.
			- explanation of cause 1:
				- explain your first main cause clearly.
				- **example**: These days, it is perhaps easier and cheaper to follow and unhealthy diet. For example, the recent boom in fast food restaurants and chains has enticed people to eat at these establishments rather than cooking healthy meals at home.
			- explanation of cause 2:
				- explain your second main cause clearly.
				- **example**: Stress is another factor that has contributed to poor health. The fast-paced corporate culture and competitive work atmospheres make for a difficult work-life balance, resulting in little to no time for eating healthy or taking care of oneself.
	- main body paragraph 2 (Effects):
		- this paragraph must focus **only on the effects**. It follows the same structure as the causes paragraph.
		- four elements for the effects paragraph:
			- topic sentence:
				- state that the paragraph will discuss the effects or consequences.
				- **example**: These lifestyle choices will have drastic long-term effects.
			- explanation of effect 1:
				- explain your first main effect and provide a supporting example.
				- **example**: If generations continue to partake in these unhealthy habits, they will continue on for generations to come. For instance, parents who have diabetes or are prone to obesity have a higher chance of passing these conditions on to their children, and so on.
			- explanation of effect 2:
				- explain your second main effect and provide support.
				- **example**: Consequently, these health problems could result in a higher cost of living. Due to increased demand for services, it is only natural that the health care industry would charge higher prices to its clients, resulting in higher costs.
	- conclusion:
		- the conclusion summarises your main points and gives a final thought.
		- remember: **no new ideas or causes/effects** in the conclusion.
		- two elements for the conclusion:
			- summary of main points:
				- using new words (paraphrasing), briefly restate the main causes and effects you discussed.
			- final concluding thought:
				- a final sentence that comments on the topic, perhaps suggesting the importance of addressing the issue.
		- example conclusion:
			- **start with cohesive device** + **summarise causes & effects** + **final thought**
			- Full Conclusion: In conclusion, poor lifestyle choices, ranging from unhealthy diets and higher stress, have certainly contributed to the decrease in health standards. If not properly taken care of, these problems could cause harmful long-term effects to future generations in terms of disease and a higher cost of living.
#### Problem and Solution essays
	- **Structural Variations**
		- This essay type asks you to discuss problems related to a specific topic and then propose solutions. It's important to read the question carefully, as the structure can change slightly.
		- **Outline A (4-Paragraph):** One paragraph for problems and one for solutions.
			- Introduction -> Problems (Body 1) -> Solutions (Body 2) -> Conclusion
		- **Outline B & C (5-Paragraph):** One paragraph for problems, followed by two separate paragraphs for solutions. This is often a better structure as it allows you to develop your solutions in more detail.
			- Introduction -> Problems (Body 1) -> Solution 1 (Body 2) -> Solution 2 (Body 3) -> Conclusion
		- We will focus on the **5-paragraph structure** as it is clear, well-developed, and helps you meet the word count.
	- Structure of your essay (5-Paragraph Model)

		- example introduction:
			- **question**: *In the developed world, the average life expectancy is increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.*
			- **Full Introduction**: People in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will be some negative consequences associated with this shift, societies can take steps to diminish these effects.
	- main body paragraph 1 (Problems):
		- This paragraph is dedicated to explaining the problems.
		- three elements for the problems paragraph:
			- topic sentence:
				- A general sentence stating that the situation causes problems.
				- **example**: The ageing population will bring about rising costs to society.
			- explanation of problem 1:
				- Explain your first problem in detail.
				- **example**: As citizens age and grow weaker, society’s tax burden increases. If a large amount of the population is elderly and retired, pension costs and taxes will increase, thus creating a burden for younger tax-paying individuals.
			- explanation of problem 2:
				- Explain your second problem in detail.
				- **example**: Additionally, older members of society will require more specialised care as their health worsens, which will bring about higher medical costs due to increased demand.
	- main body paragraph 2 (Solution 1):
		- This paragraph proposes your first solution. It should directly address one of the problems you mentioned.
		- three elements for a solution paragraph:
			- topic sentence:
				- Introduce your first solution.
				- **example**: However, there are some steps that both the government and individuals can take to mitigate these problems.
			- explanation:
				- Explain how the solution works and why it is effective.
				- **example**: Firstly, an increase in the retirement age would offset increasing costs from older generations. If people are able to retire later, the age for receiving a government-funded state pension would rise.
			- example/further detail:
				- Give more detail or an example of the solution in action.
				- **example**: Additionally, this extra time would allow the ageing population to pass on knowledge and help train younger workers in their respective fields.
	- main body paragraph 3 (Solution 2):
		- This paragraph follows the same structure and proposes your second solution.
		- outline checklist: **topic sentence** + **explanation** + **example/further detail**
		- **example paragraph**: Promoting programs and initiatives in the health care industry could also alleviate potential risks from the aforementioned problems. If the health care industry prepares for the increase in the ageing population, the potential problem of higher taxes could be avoided. For example, by promoting advances in medical programs, elderly people may be able to live with better health standards and contribute to society for a longer period of time.
	- conclusion:
		- Your conclusion should summarise the essay and give a final, powerful statement.
		- remember: **Do not introduce new problems or solutions.**
		- two elements for the conclusion:
			- summary of main points:
				- Briefly summarise the problems and the solutions you discussed.
			- final concluding thought:
				- End with a strong statement about the topic, perhaps emphasizing the need for action.
		- example conclusion:
			- **start with a cohesive phrase** + **summarise problems & solutions** + **final thought**
			- Full Conclusion: Various measures can be taken in order to offset potential problems from the ageing population. It is crucial that both individuals and governments work together in this venture.
### Ielts essay builder: Task 1

- Types of diagrams:
	- table
	- chart 
	- diagram
	- process
	- graph
	- map
- Keep in mind that you do not need to include all the information, only the main features of the given diagram

#### Pie Charts
	- **Understanding Pie Charts**
		- Pie charts show how a whole is divided into parts, usually using percentages. Your job is to describe the information you see.
		- There are two main types you will encounter:
			- **Type 1: One Pie Chart:** Your task is to **discuss** the information by selecting and reporting the main features, like the largest and smallest segments.
			- **Type 2: Two Pie Charts:** Your task is to **compare and contrast** the information between the two charts. A common mistake is to describe each chart separately. You **must** make direct comparisons to score well.
	- **The Two-Step Approach**
		- **Step One:** Analyse the chart(s) and plan how to group the information.
		- **Step Two:** Write your report using the recommended structure.
	- **Step 1: Planning and Grouping**
		- This is the most important step. Before you write, you must plan how to organize the data into two main body paragraphs.
		- **How to Group Information:**
			- **For one pie chart:** The best way is to group the largest segments together for your first body paragraph, and the smallest segments together for your second.
				- *Example:* If a chart shows age groups of 40%, 35%, 15%, 8%, and 2%, you would group the 40% and 35% pieces for Body Paragraph 1, and the other three for Body Paragraph 2.
			- **For two pie charts:** Do NOT describe Chart 1 in the first paragraph and Chart 2 in the second. Instead, group the data by **category** and compare the changes over time.
				- *Example:* If you have charts for transport in 2008 and 2018, group 'Cars' and 'Buses' together for Body Paragraph 1 and describe how their percentages decreased. Then, group 'Bicycles' and 'Walking' for Body Paragraph 2 and describe how they increased.
		- **Find the Overall Trend:** After grouping, identify the most important, general trend without using specific numbers. This will be for your 'Overview' paragraph.
			- *Example (one chart):* "Overall, the older a person was, the less likely they were to use social media."
			- *Example (two charts):* "Overall, there was a clear shift away from motorized vehicles towards more active forms of transport over the ten-year period."
	- **Structure of your Report (4 Paragraphs)**
		- introduction
		- overview
		- main body 1
		- main body 2
	- **Introduction & Overview**
		- **Introduction:** A single sentence that paraphrases the question.
		- **Overview:** One or two sentences describing the main trend(s) you identified during planning. Do not use specific numbers here.
		- **CRITICAL:** Do not give your opinion or try to explain *why* the trend is happening. Only report what you see.
	- **Writing Main Body Paragraphs: A Deep Dive**

		- **For a SINGLE Pie Chart (Social Media Example)**
			- **Main Body 1 (Largest Segments):**
				1.  **Start with Significance:** Begin by highlighting that this group is the most important feature. Use a phrase like, "In terms of the most significant feature of the chart,..."
				2.  **State Largest Category + Data:** Introduce the biggest segment with its specific percentage. "...the largest category... was the group aged 13 to 25, which accounted for 40%..."
				3.  **State Second Largest + Data:** Use a linking word like "Additionally" to introduce the next segment and its data. "...the next major segment... showed a slightly lower contribution at 35%."
				4.  **End with a Summary Analysis:** Combine the data to show a bigger picture. This demonstrates high-level understanding. "When added together, these two categories made up three quarters of Jamestown's social media users..."
			- **Main Body 2 (Smallest Segments):**
				1.  **Start with Contrast:** Use a strong contrasting phrase to signal a shift to the other side of the data. "In stark contrast,..."
				2.  **State the SMALLEST Category First:** Mention the very smallest piece of the pie to create a powerful contrast with the previous paragraph. "...the category with the lowest percentage of users included people over 55 years old, accounting for a minut 2%..."
				3.  **Group the Remaining Data:** Efficiently report the other figures in the group. Using a word like "respectively" is excellent for this. "...people aged 46 to 55 and people between 36 and 45 years of age, representing 8% and 15%, respectively."
				4.  **End with a Summary Analysis:** Just like in the first paragraph, combine the data of this second group. "Of particular note is that those aged over 36 collectively made up only 25% of Jamestown's social media users."
		- **For TWO Pie Charts (Transport Example)**
			- **Main Body 1 (First Group - e.g., Decreasing Trends):**
				1.  **Topic Sentence for the Group:** Introduce the categories you will discuss. "In terms of vehicle transport,..."
				2.  **Describe the First Year:** Report the data for your categories from the first chart (e.g., 2008). State the most popular, then the next. "...cars were the most popular choice in 2008, preferred by 42% of people. This was followed by bus usage at 30%."
				3.  **Provide a Mini-Analysis of the First Year:** Combine the data from the first year to make an analytical point. "As such, 72% of people used either of these forms of transportation."
				4.  **Shift to the Second Year with Contrast:** Use a phrase like "In contrast," to begin the comparison.
				5.  **Describe the Change:** Detail how the figures changed by the second year, using comparative language. "...personal motor vehicle use declined significantly... the percentage of bus usage dropped only slightly..."
			- **Main Body 2 (Second Group - e.g., Increasing Trends):**
				1.  **Topic Sentence for the Group:** Introduce the new categories. "In regard to other modes of transportation,..."
				2.  **Describe the First Year:** Explain that these options were initially less popular, providing the data. "...walking and cycling options were unpopular in 2008... Bicycle transport was only chosen by 17%... travelling on foot was the least popular choice at 11%."
				3.  **Shift to the Second Year with a Strong Linker:** Use a word like "Nevertheless," to show a powerful reversal of the trend.
				4.  **Describe the Change:** Use strong vocabulary to show the increase. "...by 2018, cycling and walking had experienced a spike in popularity."
				5.  **End with a Final Analysis of the Second Year:** Combine the data from the second year to make a concluding analytical statement. "Of particular note is that their collective use had made up more than half of selected transportation methods in 2018."
