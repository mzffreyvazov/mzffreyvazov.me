### Ielts essay builder: Task 2
- There are 6 types of task 2 questions
	- opinion (agree or disagree) 
	- discussion
	- causes and effects
	- problems and solutions
	- advantages and disadvantages
	- double questions 

#### Double questions
- Structure of your essay
	- introduction
	- main body 1: answer 1st
	- main body 2: asnwer 2nd
	- conclusion
- idea generation. 
	- the simplest, most straightforward answer is the best
	- do not brainstorm, just keep it simple. the most obvious answers are normally the best ones. there are no extra marks for amazing ideas
	- the first ideas you think of are normally the best.   
	- a good idea: easy to understand, relevant tot the question. asnwers the specific question. easy to explain
	- direct method for double questions:
		- you ask the question to yourself: why is this positive/negative?
		- stop overcomplicating
- introduction part:
	- introduction tells the reader what they should expect. it helps the reader follow the rest of your essay
	- always think of the reader
	- three elements to a double questions introduction
		- paraphrase the question
	- paraphrasing:
		- A well-structured, coherent argument with relevant examples and varied but natural language will always score higher than an essay stuffed with complex words used incorrectly or awkwardly. Examiners look for natural fluency, logical progression, and accurate language use, not just impressive vocabulary or intricate sentence structures.  In short: **Effectiveness > Complexity**.
	- your introduction should match up with the main body. if you write about two ideas in your introduction, then you should include all those ideas in your main bodies.
	- outline checklist (intro = paraphrased statement + outline):
		- are there any linguistic errors
	- main problems in outline and introduction:
		- less natural and precise introduction. 
- writing main body paragraph:
	- your introduction is a mini plan for your main bodies.
	- main body is the most important part of your essay

#### Opinion essays (agree or disagree)
- Structure of your essay:
	- introduction
	- supporting paragraph 1
	- supporting paragraph 2: 
	- conclusion
- idea generation:
	- decide an opinion: you agree or disagree?
	- choose the one that you feel you have more ideas for
	- Remember, the examiner wants you to fully support your arguments, not just list many ideas.
- introduction:
	- common problems in introduction:
		- talking too generally about the topic. you are supposed to answer the question directly
		- not giving your opinion
		- not supporting your opinion with main ideas
		- using an informal style
		- good and bad examples:
	- three elements for the introduction:
		- paraphrase question
		- thesis statement (your opinion)
			- This is the most important part of your introduction. You must clearly state your position on the issue.
			- **example**: This essay will argue that junk food should be taxed at a higher rate because of the good precedent set by alcohol and tobacco and the fact that the higher cost should reduce the number of people who buy it.
		- outline sentence
			- briefly state the main ideas you will use to support your position.
			- **example**: This essay will argue that junk food should be taxed at a higher rate because of the good precedent set by alcohol and tobacco and the fact that the higher cost should reduce the number of people who buy it.
- supporting paragraph 1:
	- three elements for supporting paragraph:
		- topic sentence
			- state your main idea clearly. This should match what you said you would discuss in your introduction.
			- **example**: The first reason to support higher taxes on fast food is the precedent set by alcohol and tobacco.
		- explanation:
			- a great tip: assume that the examiner knows nothing about the topic
			- you must explain **clearly** what you mean
			- **example**: Higher excise on liqueur and cigarettes has proven to curb the harm caused by these substances.
		- explanation:
			- a great tip: assume that the examiner knows nothing about the topic
			- you must explain **clearly** what you mean
			- **example**: This revenue has been used to treat health problems associated with these products and has proven useful in advertising campaigns warning people about the dangers of alcohol and tobacco abuse. Tax from fast food could be used in the same way.
		- examples:
			- the example you give should support your point
			- Think about any recent news stories, studies or adverts. If you can't think of one, make one up. The examiner won't check if it is real or not.
			- **example**: Higher excise on liqueur and cigarettes has proven to curb the harm caused by these substances.
- supporting paragraph 2: 
	- structure is exact same as supporting paragraph 1
- conclusion:
	- A good conclusion should restate your thesis statement and your main supporting points.
	- paraphrasing again
- outline checklist: **start with cohesive device** + **summarise your main points + your opinion
- example: In conclusion, junk food should be taxed at a higher rate because of the good precedent set by alcohol and tobacco and the fact that the increased cost should reduce the number of fast-food people buy.
- complete essay example:
	- question: In some countries, many people suffer from health problems due to eating too much fast food. It is, therefore, necessary for governments to impose a higher tax on this kind of food. Do you agree or disagree?
	- answer:

#### Discussion essays
- Structure of your essay (5-Paragraph Model)
	- introduction
	- main body 1: first viewpoint
	- main body 2: second viewpoint
	- conclusion
- idea generation. 
	- First, identify the two opposing views from the question.
	- For each viewpoint, come up with 1-2 solid reasons and examples.
	- Choose the simpler, more obvious reasons – they are easier to explain clearly.
	- Remember: You are not arguing for one side. You are explaining both sides fairly.
- introduction:
	- two elements for a discussion introduction:
		- paraphrase the question
			- Rewrite the topic in your own words, showing you understand the issue.
		- outline sentence
			- State that you will discuss both viewpoints in your essay.
			- **example**: This essay will examine both sides of this argument.
- main body 1 (first viewpoint):
	- three elements for this paragraph:
		- topic sentence:
			- state the first viewpoint clearly. Use a phrase like 'Some people believe that...' or 'On one hand,...'
			- **example**: On one hand, many feel that technology greatly enhances the learning experience.
		- explanation:
			- explain this first viewpoint. What are the reasons behind this argument?
			- **example**: The main reason people support this view is that the internet has made accessing information much faster and easier than ever before. Students can now find resources from around the world in seconds, and they can learn about topics in far more depth than traditional textbooks allow.
		- examples:
			- provide a relevant example that supports this first point.
			- **example**: For instance, a student researching climate change can access the latest scientific studies, watch documentaries, and even connect with experts in the field – all from their laptop.
- main body 2 (second viewpoint):
	- three elements for this paragraph:
		- topic sentence:
			- state the second viewpoint clearly. Use a linking word like 'However,' or 'On the other hand,'.
			- **example**: However, many disagree and feel that technology deprives people of real human interaction.
		- explanation:
			- explain this second viewpoint. What are the reasons behind this argument?
			- **example**: Human interaction teaches people valuable skills such as discourse, debate and empathy. Despite this, human interaction is still possible through the internet, and this essay disagrees that technology should be dismissed for this reason.
		- examples:
			- provide a relevant example that supports this second point.
			- **example**: For instance, Skype and Facebook allow people to interact in ways that were never before possible.
- conclusion:
	- your conclusion should summarise both viewpoints and clearly state your own opinion one last time.
	- two main elements for the conclusion:
		- summary of main points
			- briefly summarise the two opposing views you have discussed in your main body paragraphs.
		- reiterate your opinion
			- state which view you think is better or more important. This should be consistent with the thesis statement in your introduction.
	- outline checklist: **start with cohesive device** + **summarise both views** + **re-state your final opinion**
	- remember: **no new ideas** in the conclusion.
	- example conclusion:
		- In conclusion, while the benefits of technology, particularly the internet, allow students to tap into limitless sources of information, some still feel that people should be wary of this new phenomenon and not allow it to curb face-to-face interaction. However, as long as we carefully consider the importance of human interaction in education, the educational benefits are clearly positive.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages essays
- **Two Types of Advantages & Disadvantages Essays**
	- It is crucial to identify which type of question you are being asked, as they require different answers.
	- **Type 1: Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.**
		- Question example: *...Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.*
		- This type requires a balanced discussion. You present the advantages in one paragraph and the disadvantages in another. You **do not** give your opinion.
	- **Type 2: Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?**
		- Question example: *Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?*
		- This type asks for your opinion. You must decide which side is stronger and state this clearly in your introduction and conclusion. Your essay structure will be based on arguing for your chosen position.
	- **Important note**: You don't need many points – you need strong ones. 
		- For example, there might be many advantages to a private jet, but the single huge disadvantage (the cost) outweighs them for most people. The number of points doesn't matter; their "weight" or importance does.
- **Type 1: Discuss the Advantages and Disadvantages**
	- **Structure of your essay:**
		- introduction
		- main body 1: advantages
		- main body 2: disadvantages
		- conclusion
	- **Introduction:**
		- For this type, the introduction simply introduces the topic and states that you will discuss both sides.
		- two elements for the introduction:
			- paraphrase question
				- re-state the topic in your own words.
			- outline sentence
				- state that the essay will discuss the pros and cons of the topic.
				- **example**: This essay will suggest that experience gained and money saved are the biggest advantages of this, but delaying careers and reducing motivation to study are the primary disadvantages.
	- **Main Body Paragraph 1 (Advantages):**
		- This paragraph is dedicated only to the advantages.
		- three elements for this paragraph:
			- topic sentence
				- state the main advantages you will discuss.
				- **example**: The main advantages of a gap year are learning more about the world and earning money.
			- explanation
				- explain each advantage in more detail.
				- **example**: For students who have just finished secondary school, working or travelling for a year will allow them to learn what life is like outside of the education system. Also, third-level education is very expensive, and many students decide to work for 12 months and save money before they begin their studies.
			- example
				- provide a relevant example or expand on your explanation.
				- **example**: For instance, many European students use their gap year to work in Australia or New Zealand, gaining life experience while earning enough money to pay for their education.
	- **Main Body Paragraph 2 (Disadvantages):**
		- This paragraph focuses on the disadvantages.
		- Follow the same three-element structure as the advantages paragraph.
	- **Conclusion:**
		- For this type, simply restate both the advantages and disadvantages. Do not give your opinion about which is stronger.
		- **example**: In conclusion, taking a break from studies can be advantageous if it allows people to accumulate savings or learn more about the world. However, they should also be careful that it does not delay the start of their careers and lead to disillusionment with education.
- **Type 2: Do the Advantages Outweigh the Disadvantages?**
	- **Structure of your essay:**
		- introduction (with your opinion)
		- main body 1: discuss the stronger side
		- main body 2: discuss the weaker side (and why it's weaker)
		- conclusion (re-stating your opinion)
	- **Idea Generation:**
		- Before you write, you must decide which side is stronger: the advantages or the disadvantages.
		- Your entire essay will be built around proving why your chosen side "outweighs" the other.
	- **Introduction:**
		- This introduction must clearly state your position.
		- three elements for the introduction:
			- paraphrase question
			- thesis statement
				- this is your opinion. Clearly state whether the advantages or the disadvantages outweigh the other.
				- **example**: This essay will argue that the advantages of this outweigh the drawbacks.
			- outline sentence
				- briefly outline the points you will use to support your position.
				- **example**: The essay will first demonstrate that the earlier someone learns an additional language, the more likely they are to master it and that it brings added cognitive benefits, followed by an analysis of how the primary disadvantage, namely confusion with their native tongue, is not valid.
	- **Main Body Paragraph 1 (The Stronger Side):**
		- This paragraph discusses the side you believe is stronger (e.g., the advantages).
		- You should fully develop your points here to show why they are so significant.
	- **Main Body Paragraph 2 (The Weaker Side):**
		- This paragraph acknowledges the opposing side but explains why it is less important.
		- A good strategy: present the weaker side, then explain why it doesn't outweigh the stronger side.
	- **Conclusion:**
		- Restate your opinion about which side outweighs the other.
		- **example**: On balance, the fact that early foreign language learning leads to higher fluency and improved brain function clearly outweighs the flawed argument that it impairs the uptake of native languages.

#### Cause and Effect essays
- Structure of your essay

	- For each problem, brainstorm a possible solution. Make sure your solutions are directly linked to the problems you have identified.
- introduction:

	- two elements for a problem and solution introduction:
		- paraphrase the question
			- Restate the topic presented in the question using your own words.
		- outline sentence
			- Briefly state that you will discuss the problems and suggest solutions.
			- **example**: This essay will first suggest that the main problems caused by a greying population are a reduction in the working population and increased healthcare costs, followed by a discussion of how these problems can best be tackled by encouraging immigration and taking steps to ensure a healthier lifestyle for the ageing population.
- main body 1 (problems):
	- This paragraph focuses on the main problems caused by the issue in the question.

		- topic sentence
			- introduce the solutions you will discuss.
			- **example**: A possible solution to these problems would be to encourage immigration and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
		- explanation
			- explain how each solution addresses the problems.
		- example
			- provide a relevant example of how the solution has worked or could work.
- conclusion:
	- Summarize both the problems and solutions you discussed.
	- outline checklist: **start with cohesive phrase** + **summarise problems & solutions** + **final thought**
	- Full Conclusion: Various measures can be taken in order to offset potential problems from the ageing population. It is crucial that both individuals and governments work together in this venture.

### Ielts essay builder: Task 1

- Types of diagrams:
	- table
	- chart 
	- diagram
	- process
	- graph
	- map
- Keep in mind that you do not need to include all the information, only the main features of the given diagram

#### Pie Charts
- **Understanding Pie Charts**
	- Pie charts show how a whole is divided into parts, usually using percentages. Your job is to describe the information you see.
	- There are two main types you will encounter:
		- **Type 1: One Pie Chart:** Your task is to **discuss** the information by selecting and reporting the main features, like the largest and smallest segments.
		- **Type 2: Two Pie Charts:** Your task is to **compare and contrast** the information between the two charts. A common mistake is to describe each chart separately. You **must** make direct comparisons to score well.
- **The Two-Step Approach**
	- **Step One:** Analyse the chart(s) and plan how to group the information.
	- **Step Two:** Write your report using the recommended structure.
- **Step 1: Planning and Grouping**
	- This is the most important step. Before you write, you must plan how to organize the data into two main body paragraphs.
	- **How to Group Information:**
		- **For one pie chart:** The best way is to group the largest segments together for your first body paragraph, and the smallest segments together for your second.
			- *Example:* If a chart shows age groups of 40%, 35%, 15%, 8%, and 2%, you would group the 40% and 35% pieces for Body Paragraph 1, and the other three for Body Paragraph 2.
		- **For two pie charts:** Do NOT describe Chart 1 in the first paragraph and Chart 2 in the second. Instead, group the data by **category** and compare the changes over time.
			- *Example:* If you have charts for transport in 2008 and 2018, group 'Cars' and 'Buses' together for Body Paragraph 1 and describe how their percentages decreased. Then, group 'Bicycles' and 'Walking' for Body Paragraph 2 and describe how they increased.
	- **Find the Overall Trend:** After grouping, identify the most important, general trend without using specific numbers. This will be for your 'Overview' paragraph.
		- *Example (one chart):* "Overall, the older a person was, the less likely they were to use social media."
		- *Example (two charts):* "Overall, there was a clear shift away from motorized vehicles towards more active forms of transport over the ten-year period."
- **Structure of your Report (4 Paragraphs)**
	- introduction
	- overview
	- main body 1
	- main body 2
- **Introduction & Overview**
	- **Introduction:** A single sentence that paraphrases the question.
	- **Overview:** One or two sentences describing the main trend(s) you identified during planning. Do not use specific numbers here.
	- **CRITICAL:** Do not give your opinion or try to explain *why* the trend is happening. Only report what you see.
- **Writing Main Body Paragraphs: A Deep Dive**

	- **For a SINGLE Pie Chart (Social Media Example)**
		- **Main Body 1 (Largest Segments):**
			1.  **Start with Significance:** Begin by highlighting that this group is the most important feature. Use a phrase like, "In terms of the most significant feature of the chart,..."
			2.  **State Largest Category + Data:** Introduce the biggest segment with its specific percentage. "...the largest category... was the group aged 13 to 25, which accounted for 40%..."
			3.  **State Second Largest + Data:** Use a linking word like "Additionally" to introduce the next segment and its data. "...the next major segment... showed a slightly lower contribution at 35%."
			4.  **End with a Summary Analysis:** Combine the data to show a bigger picture. This demonstrates high-level understanding. "When added together, these two categories made up three quarters of Jamestown's social media users..."
		- **Main Body 2 (Smallest Segments):**
			1.  **Start with Contrast:** Use a strong contrasting phrase to signal a shift to the other side of the data. "In stark contrast,..."
			2.  **State the SMALLEST Category First:** Mention the very smallest piece of the pie to create a powerful contrast with the previous paragraph. "...the category with the lowest percentage of users included people over 55 years old, accounting for a minut 2%..."
			3.  **Group the Remaining Data:** Efficiently report the other figures in the group. Using a word like "respectively" is excellent for this. "...people aged 46 to 55 and people between 36 and 45 years of age, representing 8% and 15%, respectively."
			4.  **End with a Summary Analysis:** Just like in the first paragraph, combine the data of this second group. "Of particular note is that those aged over 36 collectively made up only 25% of Jamestown's social media users."
	- **For TWO Pie Charts (Transport Example)**
		- **Main Body 1 (First Group - e.g., Decreasing Trends):**
			1.  **Topic Sentence for the Group:** Introduce the categories you will discuss. "In terms of vehicle transport,..."
			2.  **Describe the First Year:** Report the data for your categories from the first chart (e.g., 2008). State the most popular, then the next. "...cars were the most popular choice in 2008, preferred by 42% of people. This was followed by bus usage at 30%."
			3.  **Provide a Mini-Analysis of the First Year:** Combine the data from the first year to make an analytical point. "As such, 72% of people used either of these forms of transportation."
			4.  **Shift to the Second Year with Contrast:** Use a phrase like "In contrast," to begin the comparison.
			5.  **Describe the Change:** Detail how the figures changed by the second year, using comparative language. "...personal motor vehicle use declined significantly... the percentage of bus usage dropped only slightly..."
		- **Main Body 2 (Second Group - e.g., Increasing Trends):**
			1.  **Topic Sentence for the Group:** Introduce the new categories. "In regard to other modes of transportation,..."
			2.  **Describe the First Year:** Explain that these options were initially less popular, providing the data. "...walking and cycling options were unpopular in 2008... Bicycle transport was only chosen by 17%... travelling on foot was the least popular choice at 11%."
			3.  **Shift to the Second Year with a Strong Linker:** Use a word like "Nevertheless," to show a powerful reversal of the trend.
			4.  **Describe the Change:** Use strong vocabulary to show the increase. "...by 2018, cycling and walking had experienced a spike in popularity."
			5.  **End with a Final Analysis of the Second Year:** Combine the data from the second year to make a concluding analytical statement. "Of particular note is that their collective use had made up more than half of selected transportation methods in 2018."
