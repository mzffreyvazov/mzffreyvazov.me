{/* ## [<Nextjs height={14} />](https://nextjs.org 'Next.js')

I have been a core maintainer of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) since 2020, collaborating closely with the React team to drive significant advancements. I led the development of Streaming SSR, Edge Runtime, React Server Components, Server Actions and other major architectural improvements in Next.js.

Working on a large-scale project like Next.js is both challenging and rewarding. Innovating on the foundation while maintaining a balance between features, performance, and simplicity is a delicate art. */}

I co-created [v0](https://v0.dev) with [Jared Palmer](https://jaredpalmer.com), [Max Leiter](https://maxleiter.com), and [shadcn](https://shadcn.com/) in 2023. I helped design the application architecture and implemented multiple parts of the core AI and streaming pipeline. */}
